## Run Locally

**Requirements:**

- Have Python and Poetry(package manager) installed
- Have docker installed, to easily run a local instance of mongo db

Steps

- git clone the repo
- Move into the project dir, and run `poetry install`
- Select apt virtual environment in VS Code.
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated

```shell
docker run --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

Alternatively, you can use `docker-compose` to spin up both the mongo-db server
and api server for you.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

You can view the autogenerated api docs at the `/docs` endpoint.

Check the `docs/` directory for more information.
